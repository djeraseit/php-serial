### Installing

Require this package, with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), in the root directory of your project.

$ composer require sanchescom/php-serial
```

## Usage

```php
<?php

use Sanchescom\Serial\Serial;

try {
    $serial = new Serial();
    
    // First we must specify the device. This works on both linux and windows (if
    // your linux serial device is /dev/ttyS0 for COM1, etc)
    $device = $serial->setDevice('COM5');

    // We can change the baud rate, parity, length, stop bits, flow control
    $device->setBaudRate(2400);
    $device->setParity("none");
    $device->setCharacterLength(8);
    $device->setStopBits(1);
    $device->setFlowControl("none");

    // Then we need to open it
    $device->open();

    // To write into
    $device->send('Hello!');

    // Or to read from
    $read = $device->read();

    // If you want to change the configuration, the device must be closed
    $device->close();

    // We can change the baud rate
    $device->setBaudRate(2400);
} catch (Exception $e) {

}

## Platform support

* **Linux**: the initially supported platform, the one I used. Probably the less
  buggy one.
* **MacOS**: although I never tried it on MacOS, it is similar to Linux and some
  patches were submitted to me, so I guess it is OK
* **Windows**: it seems to be working for some people, not working for some
  others. Theoretically there should be a way to get it done.
